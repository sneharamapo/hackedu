# Meeting on 10/29/15

## Planning

- Have a person in the front welcoming people in.
- Collecting attendance as well as club dues & pay to participate dues with student ID cards & scanner system.
- Giving 5 minutes to welcome everyone and remind club members that dues and pay-to-participate dues are due next meeting.
- Split into two groups: Hackathon group and Competitions Group
- Hackathon Group: Since we will be having our high school's first hackathon on December 18-19, we want to help teach basics about HTML/CSS by teaching the members how to create a simple landing page on their laptops.
- Competitions Group: Since at the last meeting we discussed potential ideas for entering competitions like the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow, we want the students to get itno smaller groups and discuss their ideas to create rough project proposals.

## Problems we might face

- Students might not have ideas to enter competitions on groups who they are willing to enter competitions with.
